Optimization:
can change to not check if element is in time range when being added, as this is not needed

 -----  Octree  -----
 -----  Quadtree list with quadtrees in array  -----
 The QuadtreeArray class holds an indexed dictionary of the quadtrees using times as keys, the indexing is ordered in
 reverse oreder of times as it is more likely that times will move forwards than backwards. When agents are added
 references are stored in the quadtrees. Agents themselves also hold references to the quadtrees, for each position in
 the agents path as designated by the input.
 -----  Quadtree list with quadtrees in deque  -----
